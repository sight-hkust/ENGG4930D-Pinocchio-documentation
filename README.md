# **Pinocchio**

At Pinocchio, we build a supportive community for HKUST students to grow a healthy mindset and inner wellness.
And ultimately, to reduce the stigma of mental wellness in universities and in Hong Kong.

This is the documentation repository with all the documents on our journey to develop Pinocchio.
